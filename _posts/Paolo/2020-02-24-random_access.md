Random numbers and algorithms:
===============
I was once browsing a math newsgroup, at a certain point I found a tricky 
question which made me think a bit.

The question sounded like this:
- consider all the possible numbers (Real 
or Rational, there is no big difference) between 0 and 1.
- Now please extract a random number among them.
- (within 3 seconds I thought: 0.4324), done?

At this point the person highlighted the following strange thing:
If a set contains infinite numbers, 
each of them has **ZERO** probability. How could you extract a number?

That made me think.

This is one of the typical paradoxes based on the fact that you are told by
sombody to do something, you think that you have done it, but in reality 
it is not true. It is generally called **false choice** when used by 
magicians or mentalists. For example they make you choose **freely** a card,
but in reality your choice is guided... In this case I think it was a genuine question.

`How do you pick a random number`?
Let's suppose that a human brain contains a natural mechanism which allows
 you to  *select* digits randomly (like those random number generators based
 on quantum mechanics). 
Let's also suppose that a brain can think of 100 digits per second.
It took me 3 seconds to answer, so at most I had the time for thinking at a number
with 300 digits: a lot! (well my brain is surely much slower...).

Unfortunatelly, as long as the number of digits is finite, it means that 
the mechanism for picking random number works on a finite set of numbers (and not
on an infinite set as it appeared from the question).
So we can say that at least one of them has a probability different from zero.

Another way to see the same thing is to think that, even if I had 
the "possibiliy" to choose among an infinite set of numbers, for most of them
the probability was zero. However I don't like very much this last 
interpretation. I can use it for the sake of math modelling what is going
on but.... `there are no infinities in real life`.

Infinities
==========

Well, this should be explained with a bit more of detail since in every
course of undergrad physics one deals with all sort of infinities.

The potential of a point charge diverges at the center. Every time an integral
 is carried out we are dividing an interval in an infinite set of "points" and so on
and so forth.
The models requiring infinties are in fact very pervasive, but curiously enough
people tend to forget that `no infinite quantity has ever been measured`.

The reason for this is essentially the same one that prevents a person to pick 
a number from an infinite set. In order to measure an infinite quantity,
which needs to be described with an infinite set of digits, one person needs
too much time: infinite.

Epistemology
============

Since I am walking in the kingdom of phylosophy, please let me walk a bit further.

The practical "feasability" of an action should always be taken into account.
Sometimes people have the tendency to think too much "theoretically".
If something is theoretically feasible, than it is as if we have already done it.

This is clearly not true. If an action requires too much time to be completed 
it might become practically impossible. The same happens if the action requires too 
many resources. The different paths taken which might lead to a result should also be taken into
account.

One of the most popular definitinos of science (due to `Karl Popper`), suggests
that a statement is scientific if it is possible to disprove it.
It is a very compact definition which grasps a lot of what is science, and that
is probably the reason of its popularity.

I notice however one of it limits with the following example.
`There is at least a mushroom in Norway, underneath which lives a gnome`.
It is enough to look under a mushroom to check, and the number of mushrooms
in Norway is clearly finite. In this respect there is a clear method to disprove
the sentence, and somebody might think that for this reason it becomes "scientific".
Nonetheless the practical feasibility of checking all of the mushrooms, is 
essentially zero. According to my opinion
the scientific value of the sentence is essentially zero too.

In general, I belive that an adjustment of this definition of science should
use weights for the sentences. The more "feasible" it is to disprove the 
sentence, the more scientific it becomes.

An even better way to see science should include not only partial disproofs, but 
also partial proofs and hints. Think of Cosmology for example, it is a science
which deals with the whole universe (and even more...) we can easily say that 
most of the cosmological theories, including the more accepted ones can hardly
be disproved.  


I am aware that this modified definition of science has limits (for example
is very difficult to decide the weight which defines to which extent an action
is feasible), nonetheless I think that it  


P.S.:
People who have seen an analog tester, might claim that when you measure the
resistence there is a scale with an $$\infty$$ sign on it.
This is a bit misleading, it simply means that the resistence under observation
exceeds the max range measurable by the tester.

P.P.S:
In any case I think that, at present, no definition of science completely satisfies.
Many of them carry a lot of meaning, for example Thomas Kuhn's ideas are very interesting.
