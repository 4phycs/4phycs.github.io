## Spell check Github pages posts: prose.io + prowritingaid works!

I wrote a post about random numbers and philosophy with my favourite editor: gvim. The problem is that it is rather difficult to spot the little spelling mistakes one makes.
I also made some syntax error where I used "too much + adverb" (while the correct version was "too + adverb"). For this reason I was trying to use one of those nice services like [grammarly](www.grammarly.com). 

I found a useful service for managing the markdown posts for  Github pages blog called:

- [prose.io](prose.io)

to use it, you just need to grant access to your page, and it allows to manage posts, save, commit ecc.

Unfortunatelly, Google Chrome extensions like Grammarly do not work properly with prose.io, i.e. they do not underline the mistakes or provide any suggestion. One needs to copy and paste the post on a web application supported by Grammraly.
At this point I tried many other options including:

- [webpage spell-check](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webpage-spell-check/mgdhaoimpabdhmacaclbbjddhngchjik), this works with prose.io but it simply underlines the typos (no suggestions)
- [prowritingaid](https://prowritingaid.com/en/App/ChromeExtension) this one is similar to grammarly but it does not work with prose.io

None of them, however gave me 

A tricky solution I found is the following.
When you turn on the "spell check" option of the addon `webpage spell-check` everything becomes "editable".
The cursor becomes like the one you use when entering text, even in webpages where there is no editable content. Actually it is kind of annoying since you cannot "click" on links! 

However if you use it in conjunction with `prowritingaid` on a post of your Github Pages blog it allows this latter addon to access the text, underline the mistakes and the suggestions. 

It is not perfect (for example it gives wrong suggestions if you wrap the lines arbitarily (and in the final markdown version of your document you do not notice them).

- It takes some time (few seconds) before you turn on the spell check for the highlighting to appear.
- if you change Windoes desktop the suggestions disappear and you need to turn off and on again the spell check of `webpage spell-check` and turn on again.
- it is slow to edit the text when the suggestions are on

### In summary 

In order to use prose.io with grammar suggestions one needs to:
- install `webpage spell check`
- install `prowritingaid` (and turn it on for the prose.io)
- enter `prose.io`
- **disable** the spell check of `webpage spell check`
- enter in the `_posts`  dir of Github Pages and select the desired post
- turn **on** the spell check of `webpage spell check` and wait.
