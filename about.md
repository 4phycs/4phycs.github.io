`Hello world`, my name is `Paolo`. 

Here is my [CV](https://github.com/4phycs/CV-pdf). 

{% include tip.html content="What is this blog about?" %} 

- Computer science (my current research area)
- Math
- Physics
- whatever comes to my mind.

 Why **4Phycs**?

- my first programming language: FORTRAN ( **4**-tran....)
- I have a Ph.D. in **Phys**ics
- I am not going to save the world... at most you can expect 4 fix ( **phycs** ) for some problems!
  
If you like math check the [Mathologer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1_uAIS3r8Vu6JjXWvastJg)

I like physics

I like computers and data, at [GitHub](https://github.com/4phycs) I keep some codes I wrote.

I like learning languages, like Spanish, Japanese and French.

I am the assistant professor for the course of Parallel Computing at the department of computer science 
(Dipartimento di Informatica Sistemtistica e Comunicazione, DISCO) at University of Milan-Bicocca since 2015.
I introduce the students to MPI, OpenMP, CUDA and the theory behind Map Reduce.  The language of these lessons is C/C++ and some Python.

I working actively on time series, in particular I am developing new algorithms for anomaly detection, I have developed new KPI in this respect
which extend the concept of *discord*.
