`Hello world`, my name is `Paolo`. Here is my **[CV]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/PA59_02_Nov2021.pdf)** and the **[list of my publications]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pubblicazioni-nov2021.pdf)** 
(regarding computer science and physics). 


I am a consultant.
I was a researcher of `computer and data science` at **[ID&ALab](http://www.idea.disco.unimib.it/)** 
(**[Univeristy of Milan-Bicocca](http://www.unimib.it)**). 
I keep on loving and creating new research about computer and data science (although I don't have so much time).
My main focus is on time series. I am developing new concepts and algorithms for `anomaly detection`. For example,
in this  **[article](https://rdcu.be/b2K1c)** (published on **[KAIS](https://www.springer.com/journal/10115))** we defined a new 
indicator which extends the concept of *discord*, for online analysis (a form of
unsupervised `machine learning`). More recently, we built the **[fastest algorithm for discord detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.10698)** 
 in time series, soon to appear in **[Applied Intelligence](https://www.springer.com/journal/10489)**.


I was the assistant professor for the **[Parallel Computing](https://www.unimib.it/ugov/degreecourse/212291)** course  at the 
department of computer science 
**[DISCO](https://www.disco.unimib.it/it)** at **[University of Milan-Bicocca](http://www.unimib.it)**, 
 from 2015 to 2021.
I introduceed to the students **[MPI]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/Paolo/2000-01-01-MPI.md %})**
, **[OpenMP]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/Paolo/2000-01-01-OpenMP.md %})**, 
**[CUDA]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/Paolo/2000-01-01-Cuda.md %})**
 and  the theory behind **[Map Reduce]({% link _posts/Paolo/2000-01-01-mapReduce.md %})**.  The languages of these lessons are C/C++ and some Python 
(but in any case my first love is FORTRAN).

I was part of the team which has developed the **[Pollicina project](https://www.progettopollicina.eu/)**
a social LMS for creating cultural paths within the flipped learning pedagogical approach.

I am (slowly) adding some of my codes on [GitHub](https://github.com/4phycs).

I like physics. I worked as a physicist for 3 years at **[RIKEN](https://www.riken.jp/en/)** and 1.5 years at **[Texas A&M-Commerce](https://www.tamuc.edu/)**

I like math.

I like learning new languages: English, Spanish, Japanese and French.

According to my wife (who has a lot of editing experience for academic journals), I, 
have the tendency, to,
put, comas, in, random positions.
