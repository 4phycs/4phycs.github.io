`Hello world`, my name is `Paolo`.

Here is my [CV](https://github.com/4phycs/CV-pdf).

I am a researcher of computer and data science.
I am very interested in time series, in particular I am developing new concepts and algorithms for `anomaly detection`, like a new indicator
which extend the concept of *discord*, for online analysis. 

I am the assistant professor for the course of `Parallel Computing` at the department of computer science 
(Dipartimento di Informatica Sistemtistica e Comunicazione, [DISCO](https://www.disco.unimib.it/it)) at [University of Milan-Bicocca](http://www.unimib.it), 
 since 2015.
I introduce the students to MPI, OpenMP, CUDA and the theory behind Map Reduce.  The languages of these lessons is C/C++ and some Python 
(but in any case my first love is FORTRAN).

I am part of the team which has been developing the [Pollicina project](https://www.progettopollicina.eu/)
for creating cultural paths within the flipped learning pedagogical approach.

I currently work at [Id&aLab](http://www.idea.disco.unimib.it/), 
 part of the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.disco.unimib.it/it) or Dipartimento di Informatica 
Sistemistica e Comunicazione (DISCo for friends...), 
at [University of Milan-Bicocca](http://www.unimib.it). 

I keep some of my codes on [GitHub](https://github.com/4phycs).

I like physics.

I like math.

If you like math check the [Mathologer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1_uAIS3r8Vu6JjXWvastJg).

I like learning languages, like English, Spanish, Japanese and French.
