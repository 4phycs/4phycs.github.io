`Hello world`, my name is `Paolo`. 

# [CV](https://github.com/4phycs/CV-pdf)


I am a researcher of computer and data science.

I currently work at the [Id&aLab](http://www.idea.disco.unimib.it/).
Our lab is part of the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.disco.unimib.it/it) (DISCo for friends...), 
at [University of Milan-Bicocca](http://www.unimib.it). 

At [GitHub](https://github.com/4phycs) I keep some codes I wrote.

I like physics.

I like math.

If you like math check the [Mathologer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1_uAIS3r8Vu6JjXWvastJg)

I like learning languages, like Spanish, Japanese and French.

I am the assistant professor for the course of Parallel Computing at the department of computer science 
(Dipartimento di Informatica Sistemtistica e Comunicazione, DISCO) at University of Milan-Bicocca since 2015.
I introduce the students to MPI, OpenMP, CUDA and the theory behind Map Reduce.  The language of these lessons is C/C++ and some Python 
(but in any case my first love is FORTRAN).

I working actively on time series, in particular I am developing new concepts and algorithms for anomaly detection, I have developed new KPI in this respect
which extend the concept of *discord*.
