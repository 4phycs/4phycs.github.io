`Hello world`, my name is `Paolo`   (  **[CV]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/PA47_22gen2020.pdf)**).

I am a researcher of `computer and data science` at [ID&ALab](http://www.idea.disco.unimib.it/). 
My main focus is now on time series. I am developing new concepts and algorithms for `anomaly detection`. For example,
our last publication (accepted on the 22nd of February 2020) defined a new 
indicator which extends the concept of *discord*, for online analysis (a form of
unsupervised `machine learning`). We are also about to publish a novel very fast algorithm
in the same direction.

I am the assistant professor for the course of `Parallel Computing` at the 
department of computer science 
[DISCO](https://www.disco.unimib.it/it) at [University of Milan-Bicocca](http://www.unimib.it), 
 since 2015.
I introduce the students to **[MPI]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/Paolo/2020-02-09-MPI-18-19.md %})**
, **[OpenMP]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/Paolo/2020-02-09-OpenMP-18-19.md %})**, 
**[CUDA]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/Paolo/2020-02-09-Cuda-18-19.md %})**
 and the theory behind Map Reduce.  The languages of these lessons are C/C++ and some Python 
(but in any case my first love is FORTRAN).


I am part of the team which has been developing the [Pollicina project](https://www.progettopollicina.eu/)
for creating cultural paths within the flipped learning pedagogical approach.

I am (slowly) adding some of my codes on [GitHub](https://github.com/4phycs).

I like physics.

I like math.

If you like math check the [Mathologer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1_uAIS3r8Vu6JjXWvastJg).

I like learning new languages: English, Spanish, Japanese and French.

According to my wife (who has a lot editing experience for scientific journals), I, 
have the tendency, to,
put, comas, in, random positions.
